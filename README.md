## Python Cantera Scripts for 1D Flamelet Calculations

### Overview

This repository provides a collection of Python scripts using the Cantera library to calculate 1D flamelets. These scripts are designed to model and analyze flamelet structures, which are essential in understanding complex combustion processes. The flamelet approach simplifies the treatment of turbulent combustion by assuming that the flame structure is locally laminar and can be described by a 1D steady-state solution.

### Key Features

- **Cantera Integration:** Leverages the powerful Cantera library for combustion and chemical kinetics simulations.
- **1D Flamelet Calculations:** Scripts are optimized for calculating and analyzing 1D flamelet structures, providing insight into the local flame dynamics within turbulent flows.
- **Customization:** Parameters such as pressure, temperature, and mixture composition can be easily adjusted to suit different combustion scenarios.

### Usage

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x installed.
   - Cantera library installed (`pip install cantera`).
   - Basic understanding of combustion modeling and flamelet theory.

2. **Setup:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` if a `requirements.txt` file is provided.

3. **Running the Scripts:**
   - Use the provided Python scripts to calculate flamelet structures by executing commands such as:
     ```bash
     python calculate_flamelet.py
     ```
   - Modify input parameters within the scripts to explore different flamelet configurations.

### Example

An example script is provided in the `examples` folder, demonstrating a basic flamelet calculation using default parameters. The output includes temperature profiles, species concentrations, and reaction rates, which can be visualized using matplotlib or similar plotting tools.
